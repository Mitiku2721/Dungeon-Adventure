Cage Peterson

I worked on this assignment alone.

This assignment probably took me close to 18-20 hours.

I was able to complete both the vision potion extra credit and the pit extra credit.

I don't believe there are any shortcomings in this assignment. Everything seems to be working as intended,
I had my dad and my girlfriend play it to see if I could find any bugs and none came up.

Thank you for such a good quarter Dr. Capaul. I hope to have you as a professor again sometime in the future.
